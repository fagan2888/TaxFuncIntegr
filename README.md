# TaxFuncIntegr Repository
This repository contains the code necessary to run the model and analysesin the paper, "[Integrating Microsimulation Tax Functions into a DGE Macroeconomic Model: A Canonical Example](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon/DEP_10pct.pdf)," by [Jason DeBacker](http://jasondebacker.com/), [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon/), and [Kerk L. Phillips](https://economics.byu.edu/Pages/Faculty%20Pages/Kerk-L.-Phillips.aspx).

## Python language and version
The code is written in Python language. We recommend downloading the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) of Python. Although we currently recommend using Python 3.x for future work, the code for this model is written to run only using Python 2.7. To do this, independent of your current version of Python, you can create a "conda environment" that uses Python 2.7 if you have the Anaconda distribution of Python.
